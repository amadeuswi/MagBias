  abstract={Future surveys of large-scale structure will be able to measure perturbations on the scale of the cosmological horizon, and so could potentially probe a number of novel relativistic effects that are negligibly small on sub-horizon scales. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the power spectra of clustering observables and, if measurable, would open a new window on relativistic cosmology. We quantify the size and detectability of the effects for the most relevant future large-scale structure experiments: spectroscopic and photometric galaxy redshift surveys, intensity mapping surveys of neutral hydrogen, and radio continuum surveys. Our forecasts show that next-generation experiments, reaching out to redshifts ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/814/2/145/apj521414ieqn1.gif] {$z\simeq 4,$} will not be able to detect previously undetected general-relativistic effects by using individual tracers of the density field, although the contribution of weak lensing magnification on large scales should be clearly detectable. We also perform a rigorous joint forecast for the detection of primordial non-Gaussianity through the excess power it produces in the clustering of biased tracers on large scales, finding that uncertainties of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/814/2/145/apj521414ieqn2.gif] {$\sigma ({f}_{{\rm{NL}}})\sim 1-2$} should be achievable. We study the level of degeneracy of these large-scale effects with several tracer-dependent nuisance parameters, quantifying the minimal priors on the latter that are needed for an optimal measurement of the former. Finally, we discuss the systematic effects that must be mitigated to achieve this level of sensitivity, and some alternative approaches that should help to improve the constraints. The computational tools developed to carry out this study, which requires the full-sky computation of the theoretical angular power spectra for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/814/2/145/apj521414ieqn3.gif] {${\mathcal{O}}(100)$} redshift bins, as well as realistic models of the luminosity function, are publicly available at http://intensitymapping.physics.ox.ac.uk/codes.html [http://intensitymapping.physics.ox.ac.uk/codes.html] .}

	Abstract = {We present a framework for forecasting cosmological constraints from future neutral hydrogen intensity mapping experiments at low to intermediate redshifts. In the process, we establish a simple way of comparing such surveys with optical galaxy redshift surveys. We explore a wide range of experimental configurations and assess how well a number of cosmological observables (the expansion rate, growth rate, and angular diameter distance) and parameters (the densities of dark energy and dark matter, spatial curvature, the dark energy equation of state, etc.) will be measured by an extensive roster of upcoming experiments. A number of potential contaminants and systematic effects are also studied in detail. The overall picture is encouraging---if autocorrelation calibration can be controlled to a sufficient level, Phase I of the Square Kilometre Array should be able to constrain the dark energy equation of state about as well as a DETF Stage IV galaxy redshift survey like Euclid, in roughly the same time frame.},
